# Welcome to this Ruby language course! 

This is a Ruby course for **beginners** with no previous experience in code. 

### **File structure**

It consists of 10 lessons and a collection of additional exercises. 

Each lesson has this file structure:

  - One or more files demonstrating Ruby syntax, e.g `lesson9_classes/class.rb`.
  - A file named `Exercise` to complete during the session with the trainer.
  - A `Homework` file with exercises to review main concepts before the next training session.

### **Methodology**

1. The proposed methodoly is to start looking at the syntax and **observe the output** from Ruby. 
The trainee should stablish the **logic** when comparing the input and output. 

     - It is recommended to suggest the use of `irb` to **make tests** and prove the code is providing the expected results.
     - Explaining that Ruby is an **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** language can be introduced when seeing the first *methods*, but a more detailed explanation may be given when starting to define *Classes*. 
     - A good understanding of Data Types from lesson 1 to 5 is vital to continue with the next lessons. 
     - The pace should not be necessarily fast and each lesson may require up to 90 minutes. 
     - Let the trainee ask questions and try no-sense or better code in `irb`.  
     - 
2. When the trainee demonstrates to understand the topic and feels familiar with the syntax, it is time to complete the exercises in the 'Exercise' file. 

    - It is vital to adopt an attitude to keep the student motivated. 
    - I used senteces like: 
      - `We´re not far away from starting with Classes and Ruby is not much more than this.`
      - `You´re becoming a hacker! Keep on coding!`
      - `When you know well one language, learning another language is much easier.`
    - Ask the student which projects is intending to build in the future. 

3. Make emphasis that code can only be learnt after an amount of study hours. The `Homework` that should be given as a project to think about all concepts covered until this point. The exercises are designed to employ concepts from the previous lessons. 
    
    - The solutions will be evaluated at the beginning of the next training session. 
    - If the student has tried to resolve it, it does not matter whether the syntax is totally correct. 
    - The trainer should discover those concepts which are not clear yet. 
    - It is better to repeat some theory with examples rather than letting the student do wooble steps.
